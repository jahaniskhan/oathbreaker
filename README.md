## Key Features

1. **Signal Generation and Acquisition**
   - Generates base signals, injects signatures and anomalies, and adds noise
   - Simulates signal acquisition using software-defined radio techniques

2. **RF Signal Processing**
   - Performs spectral analysis using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
   - Implements digital signal processing techniques like filtering and windowing

3. **Threat Detection and Analysis**
   - Detects anomalies in the signal using various techniques
   - Matches known threat signatures against the acquired signal

4. **Proactive Defense Simulation**
   - Simulates adaptive jamming based on detected anomalies
   - Generates interference signals to counter potential threats

5. **Utility Functions and Data Structures**
   - Provides utility functions for mathematical operations and data manipulation
   - Implements custom data structures for efficient signal processing

## Usage

The main application logic resides in the `app/Main.hs` file. It orchestrates the signal generation, acquisition, processing, threat detection, and proactive defense simulation.

```haskell:app/Main.hs
startLine: 36
endLine: 62
```

The main function performs the following steps:

1. Generates a base signal with the specified parameters
2. Injects signatures and anomalies into the signal
3. Adds noise to the signal
4. Creates interference and generates a composite signal
5. Acquires the composite signal using simulated SDR
6. Calculates the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the acquired signal
7. Detects anomalies and matches threat signatures in the signal
8. Generates an adaptive jamming signal based on the detected anomalies

```haskell:app/Main.hs
startLine: 63
endLine: 76
```

The results of the simulation, including detected anomalies, signatures, and the generated jamming signal, are logged to a file.

```haskell:app/Main.hs
startLine: 77
endLine: 95
```

Finally, the application visualizes the signals using the `plotSignals` function and records the signal data to a CSV file using the `recordSignalData` function.

```haskell:app/Main.hs
startLine: 96
endLine: 111
```

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with real SDR hardware for signal acquisition
- Implementation of more advanced machine learning algorithms for threat detection
- Optimization of signal processing algorithms for improved performance
- Expansion of the proactive defense strategies based on real-world scenarios
